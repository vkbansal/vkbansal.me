I am not an avid book reader but, at the start of 2022, I decided to start reading some books as a
New year's resolution. 2022 was also the year when I started to get into the world of personal
finance and investing. Hence you'll see that the majority of the books that I have listed below are
around the same topic.

investments in assets. He also emphasizes the need to take financial risks and to learn from failures,

[![Just Keep Buying](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51v0KSrH74L._SL250_.jpg)][just-keep-buying]

<!--rehype:class=float-right-->

This is a book on personal finance by Nick Maggiulli. It delves into saving and investing and
advocates the practice of "Just Keep Buying" (Investing) irrespective of the market conditions.
The Author presents hard evidence in form of historical data from the US markets. This book is filled
with charts and graphs, for the data geeks to nerd out. It also explains, why you need to save less
than you think and layouts some strategies, which you can use to act smarter and live richer every day.

This is a great book for anyone who wants to get a general understanding of markets and investing work.
Although this book is written in the context of the US market, I believe that the learnings from this book can
be extended to Indian markets as both these markets, have similar underpinnings. If I had to choose one
book from this list, this would be the one.
