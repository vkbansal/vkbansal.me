[Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) is a very popular and minimal MVC framework for javascript by [Jeremy Ashkenas](https://github.com/jashkenas). It gives a web application a nice structure and helps in seperation of concerns with _Models, Collections and Views_. But Backbone Views are very minimal and requires a lot of code to setup. This is where [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) steps in. It's a javascript library for building user interfaces by Facebook and people use React as the V in MVC as their website states. While researching for ways to use them together I came across many different solutions but none of them were satisfactory for me until I came across an answer by [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21709905/can-i-avoid-forceupdate-when-using-react-with-backbone/21709906#21709906). I found it very helpful and wanted to share this.

### The Mixin

Dan made a simple mixin which uses neither `setProps` nor `forceUpdate` which is what I was exactly looking for.

```javascript
var BackboneStateMixin = {
  getInitialState: function () {
    return this.getBackboneState(this.props);
  },

  componentDidMount: function () {
    if (!_.isFunction(this.getBackboneState)) {
      throw new Error('You must provide getBackboneState(props).');
    }

    this._bindBackboneEvents(this.props);
  },

  componentWillReceiveProps: function (newProps) {
    this._unbindBackboneEvents();
    this._bindBackboneEvents(newProps);
  },

  componentWillUnmount: function () {
    this._unbindBackboneEvents();
  },

  _updateBackboneState: function () {
    var state = this.getBackboneState(this.props);
    this.setState(state);
  },

  _bindBackboneEvents: function (props) {
    if (!_.isFunction(this.watchBackboneProps)) {
      return;
    }

    if (this._backboneListener) {
      throw new Error('Listener already exists.');
    }

    if (!props) {
      throw new Error('Passed props are empty');
    }

    var listener = _.extend({}, Backbone.Events),
      listenTo = _.partial(listener.listenTo.bind(listener), _, _, this._updateBackboneState);

    this.watchBackboneProps(props, listenTo);
    this._backboneListener = listener;
  },

  _unbindBackboneEvents: function () {
    if (!_.isFunction(this.watchBackboneProps)) {
      return;
    }

    if (!this._backboneListener) {
      throw new Error('Listener does not exist.');
    }

    this._backboneListener.stopListening();
    delete this._backboneListener;
  }
};
```

The idea behind this mixin is that _Backbone Models\Collections_ are set as `props` and their `toJSON` value is automatically put by mixin into `state`. One needs to override `getBackboneState(props)` for this to work, and optionally `watchBackboneProps` to tell the mixin when to call `setState` with fresh values.

### Usage Example

The above mixin can be used with any _React components_ as follows without having to worry about stale values in _Backbone Model\Collection_

```javascript
var MyComponent = React.createClass({
  mixins: [BackboneStateMixin],
  getBackboneState: function (props) {
    return {
      model: props.model.toJSON(),
      collection: props.collection.toJSON()
    };
  },
  watchBackboneProps: function (props, listenTo) {
    listenTo(props.model, 'change:someValue');
    listenTo(props.collection, 'change reset add remove');
  },
  render: function () {
    //Use JSON values from this.state.model
    //or this.state.collection
  }
});
```

### Conclusion

I found this very helpful and hope you too can benefit from it.
