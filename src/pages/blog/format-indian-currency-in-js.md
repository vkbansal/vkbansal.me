> **Update (September 2020)**: There is a better way of doing this and I have covered it [here](/blog/format-indian-currency-in-js-part-2).

Formatting a number in JavaScript can be as simple as `toLocaleString()`, but while working on a side project, I came across a scenario where neither `toLocaleString()` nor `toFixed()` was enough.

I wanted the numbers to be in `XX,XX,XXX.XX` format. So, I tried bunch of different methods.

```javascript
(254.4)
  .toLocaleString()(
    // "254.4"
    1234567.8
  )
  .toLocalString()(
    // "1,234,567.8"
    1234567.8
  )
  .toFixed(2); // "1234567.80"

Number((1234567.8).toFixed(2)).toLocaleString(); // "1,234,567.8"
```

As you can see that none of the methods worked as per my requirements.

After some googling and tinkering around with `RegExp`s, I finally found a solution.

```javascript
(1234567.8).toFixed(2).replace(/(\d)(?=(\d{2})+\d\.)/g, '$1,'); // "12,34,567.80"
```

The above solution works flawlessly as per my requirements. Basically the regex looks for a digit which is followed by digits (in groups of two) followed by a digit and a decimal point.
