## Multiple Features

Linear regression with multiple variables is also known as "multivariate linear regression".

We now introduce notation for equations where we can have any number of input variables.

$$
\begin{align*}
x^{(i)}_j &= \text{value of feature } j \text{ in the } i^{th} \text{ training example} \\
x^{i}& = \text{the column vector of all the feature inputs of the } i^{th} \text{ training example} \\
m &= \text{the number of training examples} \\
n &= \left|x^{i}\right| \text{ (number of features)}
\end{align*}
$$

Now define the multivariable form of the hypothesis function as follows, accomodating these multiple features:

$$
h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \theta_3 x_3 + \cdots + \theta_n x_n
$$

In order to have little intuition about this function, we can think about $\theta_0$ as the basic price of a house, $\theta_1$ as the price per square meter, $\theta_2$ as the price per floor, etc. $x_1$ will be the number of square meters in the house, $x_2$ the number of floors, etc.

Using the definition of matrix multiplication, our multivariable hypothesis function can be concisely represented as:

$$
\begin{equation}
h_\theta =
\begin{bmatrix}
\theta_0 \hspace{0.5em} \theta_1 \hspace{0.5em} \cdots \hspace{0.5em} \theta_n
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_0 \\
x_1 \\
\vdots \\
x_n
\end{bmatrix}
= \theta^T x
\end{equation}
$$

This is a vectorization of our hypothesis function for one training example.

> Note: So that we can do matrix operations with $\theta$ and $x$, we will set $x^{(i)}_0=1$, for all values of $i$. This makes the two vectors $\theta$ and $x^{(i)}$ match each other element-wise (that is, have the same number of elements: $n+1$).

Now we can collect all $m$ training examples each with $n$ features and record them in an $m \times n+1$ matrix. In this matrix we let the value of the superscript (the training example) also represent the row number, and, the value of the subscript (feature) also represent the column number (except the initial column is the "zeroth" column), as shown here:

$$
\begin{align*}
X =
\begin{bmatrix}
x^{(1)^T} \\
x^{(2)^T} \\
\vdots \\
x^{(m)^T} \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
x^{(1)}_0 \hspace{0.5em} x^{(1)}_1 \hspace{0.5em} \cdots \hspace{0.5em} x^{(1)}_n \\
x^{(2)}_0 \hspace{0.5em} x^{(2)}_1 \hspace{0.5em} \cdots \hspace{0.5em} x^{(2)}_n\\
\vdots \\
x^{(m)}_0 \hspace{0.5em} x^{(m)}_1 \hspace{0.5em} \cdots \hspace{0.5em} x^{(m)}_n \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

Notice above that the first row is the first training example (like the vector above), the second row is the second training example, and so forth.

Now we can define $h_\theta(X)$ as a column vector that gives the value of $h_\theta(x)$ at each of the $m$ training examples:

$$
h_\theta(X) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\theta_0 x_0^{(1)} + \theta_1 x_1^{(1)} + \cdots + \theta_n x_n^{(1)} \\
\theta_0 x_0^{(2)} + \theta_1 x_1^{(2)} + \cdots + \theta_n x_n^{(2)} \\
\vdots \\
\theta_0 x_0^{(m)} + \theta_1 x_1^{(m)} + \cdots + \theta_n x_n^{(m)} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

But again using the definition of matrix multiplication, we can represent this more concisely:

$$
h_\theta(X) =
\begin{bmatrix}
x_0^{(1)} \hspace{0.5em} x_1^{(1)}  \cdots  x_n^{(1)} \\
x_0^{(2)} \hspace{0.5em} x_1^{(2)} \cdots x_n^{(2)} \\
\vdots \\
x_0^{(m)} \hspace{0.5em} x_1^{(m)}  \cdots  x_n^{(m)} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\theta_0 \\
\theta_1 \\
\vdots \\
\theta_n
\end{bmatrix}
= X\theta
$$

## Cost function

For the parameter vector $\theta$ (of type $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ or in $\mathbb{R}^{(n+1)\times1}$), the cost function is:

$$
J(\theta) = \frac {1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}\left( h_\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)} \right)^2
$$

### Matrix notation

$$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m}(X\theta-\vec{y})^T(X\theta - \vec{y})
$$

Where $\vec{y}$ denotes the vector of all $y$ values.

## Gradient Descent for Multiple Variables

The gradient descent equation itself is generally the same form; we just have to repeat it for our $n$ features:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \text{repeat until covergence: } \lbrace \\
& \hspace{2em}  \theta_0 := \theta_0 - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}\right) \cdot  x_0^{(i)}\\
& \hspace{2em} \theta_1 := \theta_1 - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}\right) \cdot  x_1^{(i)} \\
& \hspace{2em} \theta_2 := \theta_2 - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}\right) \cdot  x_2^{(i)} \\
& \hspace{2em} \cdots \\
& \rbrace
\end{align*}
$$

In other words:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \text{repeat until covergence: } \lbrace \\
& \hspace{2em} \theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}\right) \cdot  x_j^{(i)} \\
& \rbrace \hspace{5em}   \text{simultaneously update } \theta_j \text{ for  }j = (0,1,2,..n)
\end{align*}
$$

### Matrix Notation

The Gradient Descent rule can be expressed as:

$$
\theta := \theta - \alpha \nabla J(\theta)
$$

Where $\nabla J(\theta)$ is a column vector of the form:

$$
\nabla J (\theta) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_0} \\
\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_1} \\
\vdots \\
\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_n} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The $j^{th}$ component of the gradient is the summation of the product of two terms:

$$
\begin{align*}
\; \frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_j} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^m \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)} )- y^{(i)} \right) \cdot x_j^{(i)} \\
\; = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^m  x_j^{(i)} \cdot \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)} )- y^{(i)} \right)
\end{align*}
$$

Sometimes, the summation of the product of two terms can be expressed as the product of two vectors.

Here, the term $x^{(i)}_j$ represents the $m$ elements of the $j^{th}$ row $\vec{x}_j$ ($j^{th}$ feature $\vec{x}_j$) of the training set $X$.

The other term $\left(h_\theta(x^{(i)})−y^{(i)}\right)​$ is the vector of the deviations between the predictions $h_\theta(x^{(i)})​$ and the true values $y^{(i)}​$. Re-writing $\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_j}​$, we have:

$$
\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_j} = \frac {1}{m} \vec{x}_j^T (X \theta - \vec{y}) \\
\nabla J(\theta) = \frac{1}{m} X^T (X \theta - \vec{y})
$$

Finally, the matrix notation (vectorized) of the Gradient Descent rule is:

$$
\theta := \theta - \frac{\alpha}{m}X^T(X\theta - \vec{y})
$$

## Feature Normalization

We can speed up gradient descent by having each of our input values in roughly the same range. This is because $\theta$ will descend quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and so will oscillate inefficiently down to the optimum when the variables are very uneven.
The way to prevent this is to modify the ranges of our input variables so that they are all roughly the same.

Ideally: $−1≤xi≤1$ or $−0.5≤xi≤0.5$

These aren't exact requirements; we are only trying to speed things up. The goal is to get all input variables into roughly one of these ranges, give or take a few.

Two techniques to help with this are **feature scaling** and **mean normalization**. Feature scaling involves dividing the input values by the range (i.e. the maximum value minus the minimum value) of the input variable, resulting in a new range of just 1. Mean normalization involves subtracting the average value for an input variable from the values for that input variable, resulting in a new average value for the input variable of just zero. To implement both of these techniques, adjust your input values as shown in this formula:

$$
x_i := \frac{x_i-\mu_i}{ s_i}
$$

Where $\mu_i$ is the average of all the values and $s_i$ is the maximum of the range of values minus the minimum or $s_i$ is the standard deviation.

**Example**: $x_i$ is housing prices in range $100-2000$. Then,

$$
x_i := \frac{price - 1000}{1900}
$$

where $1000$ is the average price and $1900$ is the maximum ($2000$) minus the minimum ($100$).

### Gradient Descent Tips

Debugging gradient descent:

- Make a plot of the cost function, $J(\theta)$ over the number of iterations of gradient descent. If $J(\theta)$ ever increases, then you probably need to decrease $\alpha$.
- Automatic convergence test: Declare convergence if $J(\theta)$ decreases by less than $\epsilon$ in one iteration, where $\epsilon$ is some small value such as $10^{−3}$. However in practice it's difficult to choose this threshold value.
- It has been proven that if learning rate $\alpha$ is sufficiently small, then $J(\theta)$ will decrease on every iteration. Andrew Ng recommends decreasing $\alpha$ by multiples of $3$.

## Features and Polynomial Regression

We can improve our features and the form of our hypothesis function in a couple different ways. We can combine multiple features into one. For example, we can combine $x_1$ and $x_2$ into a new feature $x_3$ by taking $x_1 \cdot x_2$.

### Polynomial Regression

Our hypothesis function need not be linear (a straight line) if that does not fit the data well.

We can change the behavior or curve of our hypothesis function by making it a quadratic, cubic or square root function (or any other form).

For example, if our hypothesis function is $h_\theta(x)=\theta_0+\theta_1x_1$ then we can simply duplicate the instances of $x_1$ to get the quadratic function $h_\theta(x)=\theta_0+\theta_1x_1+\theta_2x_1^2$ or the cubic function $h_\theta(x)=\theta_0+\theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_1^2 + \theta_3 x_1^3$

In the cubic version, we have created new features $x_2$ and $x_3$ where $x_2=x_1^2$ and $x_3=x_1^3$.
To make it a square root function, we could do: $h_\theta(x)=\theta_0+\theta_1x_1+\theta_2\root \of{x_1}$

One important thing to keep in mind is, if you choose your features this way then feature scaling becomes very important.

eg. if $x_1$ has range $1 - 1000$ then range of $x_1^2$ becomes $1 - 1000000$ and that of $x_1^3$ becomes $1 - 1000000000$.

## Normal Equation

The "Normal Equation" is a method of finding the optimum theta without iteration.

$$
\theta = (X^TX)^{-1} X^TY
$$

There is no need to do feature scaling with the normal equation.

The following is a comparison of gradient descent and the normal equation:

|       Gradient Descent       |      Normal Equation      |
| :--------------------------: | :-----------------------: |
|     Need to choose alpha     |  No need to choose alpha  |
|    Needs many iterations     |    No need to iterate     |
| Works well when $n$ is large | Slow if $n$ is very large |

<!--{table: .table}-->

With the normal equation, computing the inversion has complexity $O(n^3)$. So if we have a very large number of features, the normal equation will be slow. In practice, when $n $exceeds 10,000 it might be a good time to go from a normal solution to an iterative process.

### Normal Equation Non-invertibility

When implementing the normal equation in octave we want to use the `pinv` function rather than `inv`.

$X^TX$ may be noninvertible. The common causes are:

- Redundant features, where two features are very closely related (i.e. they are linearly dependent)
- Too many features (e.g. $m\leq n$). In this case, delete some features or use **regularization** (explained in a later lesson).

Solutions to the above problems include deleting a feature that is linearly dependent with another or deleting one or more features when there are too many features.

### Derivation

We know that cost function is represented by:

$$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m}(X\theta-\vec{y})^T(X\theta - \vec{y})
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{align*}
J(\theta) &= \frac{1}{2m}(X\theta-\vec{y})^T(X\theta - \vec{y}) \\
& = \frac{1}{2m} \left( (X\theta)^T - \vec{y}^T \right) (X\theta - \vec{y}) \\
& = \frac{1}{2m} \left( (X\theta)^T X\theta  + \vec{y}^T\vec{y} - \vec{y}^TX\theta - (X\theta)^Ty\right) \\
& = \frac{1}{2m} \left( \theta^TX^TX\theta - 2 (X\theta)^T\vec{y} + \vec{y}^T \vec{y}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

and the derivative is

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta} &= \frac{1}{2m} (2X^TX\theta - 2X^T\vec{y}) \\
& = \frac{1}{m} X^T(X\theta - \vec{y})
\end{align}
$$

For least cost, the derivative must be $0$, thus:

$$
\begin{align}
\hspace{5em} \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta} &= 0 \\ \\
\frac{1}{m}(X^TX\theta -  X^T \vec{y}) &= 0 \\ \\
(X^TX\theta -  X^T \vec{y}) &= 0 \\ \\
X^TX\theta  &= X^T \vec{y} \\ \\
\theta &= (X^TX)^{-1}X^T\vec{y}
\end{align}
$$
